# COSC 480 DS Project

The project guidelines can be found on the [course website](https://github.com/colgate-cosc480ds/lecture).


Our taxi data can be found at the following link: http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml
To reproduce our results, run " ./filter_rides.sh [taxi_data_file.csv] ", the results will be stored in rides.csv.

Each month takes about 15-20 minutes to filter, so running on a selection of the first 100,000 rows from the taxi
data is much easier. This can be easily accomplished using bash. 

Financial data was obtained from a database with restricted access, so it is available in our repository.
