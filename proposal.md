## Project proposal

We would like to study Kaggle taxi-ride datasets for Uber and other companies, along with yahoo finance datasets on financial services companies’ revenues. Our hypothesis is that we can use taxi information from the block surrounding a financial services company, to help ascertain how late their employees are working. This may act as a proxy to derive the average hours employees are working in any given quarter. Since long hours may be indicative of increased deal activity, we surmise that this may help us predict their revenues in the following quarter or two quarters. We don’t know exactly how this will manifest, so overall, we want to know how taxi pickups near investment banks can help predict the firms’ revenues. We will likely analyze the data against revenues for each business segment along with total revenues and with a time lag at different intervals into the future, as we may find a higher correlation with revenues a few quarters out as opposed to the current observed quarter.
