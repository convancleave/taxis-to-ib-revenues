# Weekly Status Reports

Each week, please spend 5-10 minutes writing a brief status report.  This does not need to be highly detailed. 
Some examples are provided below that give some indication of the level of detail.

*Copy the template below for each subsequent week.  Please put the most recent week at the **TOP** of the page.*


## Week 1

Report for the week of 3/20/17 to 3/27/17.

What did each project team member do this week?

- *Conor Oliver: This week, I worked on writing a script to take our coordinates of our banks, compare with taxi data,
 and output into a new csv file. My code is in taxi.py and filter rides.sh. However, I only ran the code on 1 month of 
 our data due to time considerations. We may have to optimize somehow before running further.*
- *Teddy Owen: This week, he manually recorded the locational data of ~20 prominent investment banks in NYC and worked
to obtain financial data on their earning, returns, etc. *
- *Connor Van Cleave: This week, he worked to find and migrate the NYC taxi data to a SQL database. However,
 we ultimately cdecided that our best approach for working with this data was to download csv's and 
 stream the data using bash and python, and then maybe build a SQL DB * 

Provide a rough estimate of the division of labor:

- *Conor Oliver: 35%*
- *Teddy Owen: 40%
- *Connor Van Cleave: 25% (essays)*

What are the team's goals for next week?

*[Brief description]: Our main goal for next week is to find a way to join our financial data and taxi data and get a rough
idea of how/if our data has any correlations. Maybe analyze the number of rides on average for different times
throughout the day (this should give us an idea if there is a spike in rides when people get off work)*

## Week 2

Report for the week of 3/27/17 to 4/10/17.

What did each project team member do this week?

- *Conor Oliver: This week, he worked with Teddy on to decide how to process the data in a computationally efficient way using the API or csv files.
- *Teddy Owen: This week, he helped Conor decide how to process the data in a computationally efficient way.
- *Connor Van Cleave: This week, he worked to find and setup the API for acquiring taxi data more efficiently. This should help us begin to process some of the data this week. 

Provide a rough estimate of the division of labor:

- *Conor Oliver: 75%*
- *Teddy Owen: 12.5%
- *Connor Van Cleave: 12.5% *

What are the team's goals for next week?

*[Brief description]: Our main goal for next week is to begin analyzing our data with the api.

## Week 3

Report for the week of 4/10/17 to 4/17/17.

What did each project team member do this week?

- *Conor Oliver: This week, worked on beginning data visualizations for Wednesday's presentation.
- *Teddy Owen: This week, prepared the finance data for more regression/visualization work in tomorrow's lab, worked on a background slide for the presentation.
- *Connor Van Cleave: Ran into connectivity issues with the API, hoping to get those resolved in the lab. Worked on some possible regressions to run for the presentation on Wednesday. 

Provide a rough estimate of the division of labor:

- *Conor Oliver: 33.3%
- *Teddy Owen: 33.3%
- *Connor Van Cleave: 33.3% 

What are the team's goals for next week?

*[Brief description]: Get a presentation together for Wednesday and get the python library API working

## Week 4

Report for the week of 4/17/17 to 4/24/17.

What did each project team member do this week?

- *Conor Oliver: Continued gathering and cleaning data with python script. Lots more to go!
- *Teddy Owen: Continued gathering and cleaning data with python script.
- *Connor Van Cleave: Final effort on using an API, ultimately decided to just download all data and use python script to clean. 

Provide a rough estimate of the division of labor:

- *Conor Oliver: 33.3%
- *Teddy Owen: 33.3%
- *Connor Van Cleave: 33.3% 

What are the team's goals for next week?

*[Brief description]: Find a better way to handle data and run analysis than just python. This is going to be through a DB

## Week 5

Report for the week of 4/24/17 to 4/31/17.

What did each project team member do this week?

- *Conor Oliver: Used all the lab computers to simultaneously download data and run script. Gathered 60 individual taxi data files, ran script on them to produce csv's to be ready to add to postgres SQL DB.
- *Teddy Owen: Planned out tools to make running our regressions easier
- *Connor Van Cleave: Used all the lab computers to simultaneously download data and run script. Gathered 60 individual taxi data files, ran script on them to produce csv's to be ready to add to postgres SQL DB. Also created the SQL database from the csv files

Provide a rough estimate of the division of labor:

- *Conor Oliver: 40%
- *Teddy Owen: 10%
- *Connor Van Cleave: 50% 

What are the team's goals for next week?

*[Brief description]: Finish data analysis (regressions, any machine learning we want to do).
